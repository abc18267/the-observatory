Charts are great. Bar charts, line charts, scatter plots. They show you what's there. But they don't make you feel it.

Sound does something different. When you map a dataset to frequencies and rhythms, your brain processes it in a new way. Patterns that are invisible in a spreadsheet become obvious in a melody.

## Sonification 101

The idea is simple. Take a data point. Map it to a musical parameter. Pitch, volume, duration, timbre. Play it. Repeat for the next data point.

Temperature data becomes a rising melody as summer approaches. Stock prices become a jittery rhythm that calms during weekends. Heart rate data becomes a drum pattern that speeds up when you exercise.

## What I Learned

The hardest part isn't the code. It's choosing the right mapping. Map everything to pitch and it sounds like noise. Map too little and it sounds like a single note.

The sweet spot is 2-3 parameters. Pitch for the main variable. Volume for the secondary. Maybe a filter sweep for the third. Your ears can track these independently. Add more and it becomes mush.

## Try It Yourself

Grab any CSV. Open Tone.js. Map column A to a synth's frequency. Hit play. You'll hear your data in a way you've never experienced it before.

The numbers will sing.
