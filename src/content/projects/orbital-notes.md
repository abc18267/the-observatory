Most note apps are flat. Lists and folders. But ideas don't work that way. They connect, cluster, and sometimes collide.

Orbital Notes places each note in a 2D space. Related notes attract each other. Unrelated notes drift apart. Over time your knowledge base organizes itself into visible clusters.

You can grab a note and fling it. Watch what it gravitates toward. Sometimes the connections surprise you. The physics simulation runs on Matter.js with custom gravity rules tuned for readability.
