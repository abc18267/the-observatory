Radio telescopes produce massive datasets. Most of it is noise. But hidden in that noise are patterns. This tool maps radio frequency data to musical notes and visual shapes.

Each frequency band gets its own voice. Low bands become deep drones. High bands become crystalline pings. The result is a soundscape that shifts as you scrub through hours of observation data.

The visual layer renders frequency intensity as a flowing particle field. Bright signals create dense clusters. Silence creates voids. You can literally see the shape of the universe's background hum.
